System Overview
===============

QEP supports three PCIe physical functions - PF0 for device management, PF1 for compute acceleration
and PF2 for Network acceleration. The Ethernet subsystem added to the static region
of the shell is accessible to the host via PF2.

For details on Hardware Features refer to Hardware documentation on the QEP Lounge.


The high level system software overview using the DPDK framework for network packet processing is depicted below.

Xilinx provides DPDK driver that registers the HW platform (PF2) with DPDK framework as Ethernet device
and implements the necessary device operations for data path setup and packet processing.


QEP DPDK Driver supports the following list of features

System Overview
===============

QEP has three PCIe physical functions - PF0 for device management, PF1 for compute acceleration
and PF2 for Network acceleration. The Ethernet subsystem added to the static region
of the shell is accessible to the host via PF2.

For details on Hardware Features refer to Hardware documentation on the QEP Lounge_.

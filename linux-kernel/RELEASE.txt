This release is based on 4.15.0-64-generic Linux kernel and verified on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS.

This release is validated on QEP HW design with standard Linux tools such as
hping3 and standard interface is configured through ifconfig and IP utility.

This release is validated to confirm the functionality of security block for
MAC & VLAN filtering, Checksum offload and RSS.

===================
- 100G Ethernet MAC
- Read MAC address from security block
- Streaming Traffic Manager for Networking

KNOWN BUGS:
===========
- IPv4 fragmented packets are directed to different RSS redirection table entries.

Release: 1.2.0
==============

This release is based on DPDK v18.11.

This release is validated on QEP HW design with standard DPDK example
applications like test-pmd, dpdk-pktgen, proc-info.

This release is validated to confirm the functionality of security block for
MAC & VLAN filtering, Checksum offload, RSS.


SUPPORTED FEATURES:
===================
- 100G Ethernet MAC
- Read MAC address from security block
- Streaming Traffic Manager for Networking
- QDMA for data transfer
- 256 streaming queues for Network PF
- TCP and UDP checksum offload for IPv4 packets
- Receive side scaling (RSS) support for below packet types
	- IPv4
	- IPv4 TCP
	- IPv6
	- IPv6 TCP
- Additional driver APIs for debug and statistics
- Support rte_flow_ops for RSS configuration


KNOWN BUGS:
===========
- Traffic stops on abruptly killing testpmd and restarting it.
- IPv4 fragmented packets are directed to different RSS redirection table entries.
- DMAR error observed with IOMMU enabled when testpmd is run after Linux driver is run and removed.
- Testpmd fails when PF from multiple cards are assigned to a single VM and binded to DPDK.


LIMITATIONS:
===========
- Multiple restart of pdump application cannot be verified due to cleanup issues in pdump application in DPDK v18.11

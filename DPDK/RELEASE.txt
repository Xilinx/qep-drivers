Release: 1.3.0
==============

This release is based on DPDK v18.11.

This release is validated on QEP HW design with standard DPDK example
applications like test-pmd, dpdk-pktgen, proc-info.

This release is validated to confirm the functionality of security block for
MAC & VLAN filtering, Checksum offload, RSS.


SUPPORTED FEATURES:
===================

1.2.0 Features
--------------

- 100G Ethernet MAC
- Read MAC address from security block
- Streaming Traffic Manager for Networking
- QDMA for data transfer
- 256 streaming queues for Network PF
- TCP and UDP checksum offload for IPv4 packets
- Receive side scaling (RSS) support for below packet types
	- IPv4
	- IPv4 TCP
	- IPv6
	- IPv6 TCP
- Additional driver APIs for debug and statistics
- Support rte_flow_ops for RSS configuration

1.3.0 Features
--------------

- Added support for following eth_dev_ops callbacks
	- dev_reset
	- rx_queue_count
	- rx_descriptor_status
	- tx_descriptor_status
	- tx_done_cleanup
	- queue_stats_mapping_set
	- get_regs
	- xstats_get_names_by_id
	- xstats_get
	- xstats_get_by_id
	- xstats_reset
	- dev_supported_ptypes_get
- Added support to dump CMAC statistics as part of xstats_get() callback.
- Added rte_pmd_qep_dbg_lbusinfo() API to get LBUS debug information.
- Enhanced proc-info application to dump QEP status and statistics information. 
  Provided a patch to proc-info application with the release.

KNOWN BUGS:
===========
- Traffic stops on abruptly killing testpmd and restarting it.
- IPv4 fragmented packets are directed to different RSS redirection table entries.
- DMAR error observed with IOMMU enabled when testpmd is run after Linux driver is run and removed.
- Testpmd fails when PF from multiple cards are assigned to a single VM and binded to DPDK.
- When RSS is enabled, Non-IP traffic is routed to queue id 0 irrespective of the queue id 
  programmed in indirection table at index 0.

LIMITATIONS:
===========
- Multiple restart of pdump application cannot be verified due to cleanup issues in pdump application in DPDK v18.11
